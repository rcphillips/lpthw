#prints a string
print("I will now count my chickens:")
#prints a string, and then, prints what appears to be a float. The output of a calculation.
#I think maybe it's converted to float because of the division?
print("Hens", 25.0 + 30.0 / 6.0)
#this does the same thing as the previous line, but the exact calculation is hard to suss out.
print("Roosters", 100.0 - 25.0 * 3.0 % 4.0)
#this prints a string
print("Now I will count the eggs:")
#this prints a value, the result of the calculation
print(3.0 + 2.0 + 1.0 - 5.0 + 4.0 % 2.0 - 1.0 / 4.0 + 6.0)
#this prints a string
print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")
#this prints False, because 3 + 2 is not less than 5 -7 
print(3.0 + 2.0 < 5.0 - 7.0)
#This prints a string, and then, adds a space, and then, prints the result of the calculation
print("What is 3 + 2?", 3.0 + 2.0)
#This prints a string, and then, adds a space, and then, prints the result of the calculation
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5.0 - 7.0)
#This prints a string.
print("Oh, that's why it's False.")
#this prints a string
print("How about some more.")
#these three print a string, and then evaluate the equation, as 
print("Is it greater?", 5.0 > -2.0) #True
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5.0 >= -2.0) #True
print("Is it less or equal?", 5.0 <= -2.0) #False
