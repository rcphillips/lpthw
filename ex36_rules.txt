Rules for if-statements:
1. Every if-statement must have an else.
2. If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense, then you must use a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies.
3. Never nest if-statements more than two deep, and always try to do them one-deep
4. Treat if-statements like paragraphs, where each if-elif-else grouping is like a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
5. Boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations to variables EARLIER IN THE FUNCTION and use a GOOD NAME for the variable. (smart!)

Rules for Loops:
1. Use a while-loop only to loop forever, and that means probably never. This only applies to Python, other languages are different.
2. Use a for-loop for all other kinds of looping, especially if there is a fixed or limited number of things to loop over.

Tips for Debugging:
1. Do not use a "debugger". You do not get any specific useful information.
2. The best way to debug is to print the values of variables at different points in the program to see where they go wrong.
3. Make sure parts of your programs work as you work on them. Do not write massive files of code. Code a little, run, fix, repeat.

The Best Way to Work on a Piece of Software:
in small chunks. Like this:

1. On a sheet of paper or an index card, write a list of tasks you need to complete.
2. Pick the easiest thing
3. Write out English comments in your source file as a guide for how you would accomplish this.
4. Write some of the code under the comments.
5. Quickly run the script to see if it worked.
6. Keep working in a cycle of write, run, fix.
7. Cross the task off, pick the next easiest, and repeat.
